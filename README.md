# Curricularica

This is the project for COMP3011J Mobile Computing.

**Curricularica** is an Android app for college students to view and manage their timetables, deadlines and incoming exams. It also provides features like widgets and AI copilot support.
It contains three major sections: **Timetable**, **Deadlines** and **Copilot**.

+ **Timetable:** Users can view and manage their courses here. This section shows the basic information of a timetable, including which semester in which academic year this timetable is for and what courses the user have this week.
+ **Deadlines:** Users can manage when their assignment are due and when they have exams to take.
+ **Copilot:** Users can get suggestions and advices from an AI-powered chatbot called *Curricularica Copilot*. They can ask questions about the knowledge regarding the courses and the copilot can provide answers to them.
