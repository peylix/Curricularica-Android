### COMP3011J Mobile Computing Project

**Curricularica** is an Android app for college students to view and manage their timetables, deadlines and incoming exams. It also provides features like widgets and AI copilot support.
It contains three major sections: **Timetable**, **Deadlines** and **Copilot**.

+ **Timetable:** Users can view and manage their courses here. This section shows the basic information of a timetable, including which semester in which academic year this timetable is for and what courses the user have this week.
+ **Deadlines:** users can manage when their assignment are due and when they have exams to take.
+ **Copilot Section:** In this section the user can get suggestions and advices from an AI-powered chatbot called *Curricularica Copilot*. Users can ask questions about the courses and the copilot can provide answers to them.
